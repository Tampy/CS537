The model was found by trying to search for sites online that provide free .obj models.
Finding tf3dm.com, I simply searched for a simple car model. I settled on this one
because other car models were too complex and crashed the program.

This model was incorporated into the scene as the car the user drives. It is
imported via GLM and placed in a position (by rotating it 180) where it is facing
the village.

The texture of the car came with the model as a DDS. I converted it to PPM using
Paint.NET.

This model was found by searching tf3dm, which I knew about since I had found the car
model on the same site. I  searched for a simple house that looked like it belonged in
a village.

THe model was used as the village the car drives up to. The model was imported using
GLM as the car was. I created multiple houses bycalling for the house multiple times, 
each time translating the house to a different location. This created a small village 
of identical houses.

The texture of the house came with the model as a DDS. I converted it to PPM using
Paint.NET.
